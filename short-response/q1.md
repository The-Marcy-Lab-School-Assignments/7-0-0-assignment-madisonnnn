# Question

In your own words, what is React and what are the benefits of using it?

# Answer
React is a JavaScript library for building user-interfaces. It is a much more concise version of DOM and allows JS and HTML to be used in the same file.

You're on the right track! However, in React, we are not writing HTML and JS in the same file. Instead, we're using JSX, which allows us to write HTML-like syntax within JavaScript files. This syntax is then transformed into JavaScript code that React uses to efficiently manage the DOM.
